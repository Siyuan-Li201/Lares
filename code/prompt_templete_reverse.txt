Suppose you are a software reverse engineer with strong code analysis skills. You have the source code of a function and the pseudo code obtained through binary decompilation. The variable name information in the Pseudo code is lost. "Pseudo code slice" is the target code in the pseudo code. Try to find the code in the "source code" that is most similar to the target code in the "pseudo code". Must only output your findings as a JSON dictionary.

output format:
{
    "new match result":{
        "a line of pseudo code": "coresponding code in source code",
        more result...
    },
    "corresponding source code": "must output the unchanged original corresponding lines in source code here"
}

pseudo code slice:
<pseudo_slice_label>


pseudo code:
<pseudo_code_label>


source code:
<source_code_label>
