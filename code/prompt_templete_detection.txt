Suppose you are a software reverse engineer with strong code analysis skills. You have the source code of a function and the pseudo code obtained through binary decompilation. The variable name information in the Pseudo code is lost. Lines in the source code that end with "    // patch_code" are patch codes. Some patch codes contain macro definitions in comments. Lines in the source code that end with "    // locate_code" are locate codes. Can you identify the patch codes and locate codes in the pseudo code that corresponds to the patch code? Find all possible coresponding varibles. Must only output your findings as a JSON dictionary.

output format:
{
    "new match result":{
        "a line of patch code": ["coresponding code1 in pseudo code", "coresponding code2 in pseudo code", ...],
        more result...
    },
    "coresponding variables":{
        "variable 1 in source code": "the coresponding variable 1 in pseudo code",
        more result...
    },
    "corresponding pseudo code": "the corresponding pseudo code snippet"
}

source code:
<source_code_label>

pseudo code:
<pseudo_code_label>
