Suppose you are a software reverse engineer with strong code analysis skills. You have the source code of a function and the pseudo code obtained through binary decompilation. The variable name information in the Pseudo code is lost. Lines in the source code that end with "# patch line" are patch codes. Can you identify the code in the pseudo code that corresponds to the patch code? Must only output your findings as a JSON dictionary.

output format:
{
    "new match result":{
        "a line of patch code": "coresponding code in pseudo code",
        more result...
    },
    "corresponding pseudo code": "the corresponding pseudo code snippet"
}

source code:
<source_code_label>

pseudo code:
<pseudo_code_label>
