 I'll analyze the decompiled pseudo code to determine whether it matches the patched or pre-patch version by examining the matching results carefully.

Let me first understand the diff file and the context:

1. The patch changes `if (TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION &&` to `if (s->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION &&`
2. This changes a version comparison from "greater than or equal to TLS1_2_VERSION" to "exactly equals TLS1_2_VERSION"

Now I'll analyze both match results:

I've researched how TLS versions work in OpenSSL to better understand the context of the code. Now, let me analyze both match results in detail.

First, understanding the key difference in the patch:
- Pre-patch: `if (TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION &&`
- Patched: `if (s->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION &&`

The critical change is from a "greater than or equal to" comparison to an "exactly equal to" comparison, which limits the condition to only apply for TLS 1.2 specifically.

Now let's analyze both match results:

```json
{
    "evidence": {
        "p_result_analysis": [
            "The conditional logic in the patched version matches 's->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION' with '**(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) ^ 0x303'",
            "Correct return value placement - 'result = 131200' is executed first, then the conditional overrides it if needed"
        ],
        "v_result_analysis": [
            "The conditional logic has syntax issues - the matching line for 'alg2 == (SSL_HANDSHAKE_MAC_DEFAULT|TLS1_PRF)' doesn't properly close",
            "Incorrect return value sequence - the return values appear in reverse order compared to the original code logic"
        ],
        "reasoning": "The p_result matches show better semantic alignment with the patched code. The p_result correctly implements the 'exact equality' check for TLS 1.2 version (0x303), whereas the v_result has structural issues in its condition expressions. Additionally, the p_result maintains the correct control flow where a default value is set and then potentially overridden by the conditional, matching the patched version's logic."
    },
    "correct_result": "patched version"
}
```
