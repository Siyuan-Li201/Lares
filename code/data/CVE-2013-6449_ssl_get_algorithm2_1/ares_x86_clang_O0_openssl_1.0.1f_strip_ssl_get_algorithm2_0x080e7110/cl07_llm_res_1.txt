 I'll analyze the decompiled pseudo code to determine whether it's the patched or pre-patch version by examining the matching results. Let me carefully review the diff, variable context, and both match results.

Looking at the provided information, I'll analyze the two matching results to determine if the decompiled code corresponds to the patched or pre-patch version.

First, let me understand the key differences in the patch. The diff shows:
```diff
-	if (TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION &&
+	if (s->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION &&
```

This changes the condition from checking if the TLS version is greater than or equal to TLS 1.2 to checking if it equals exactly TLS 1.2.

Now, let's analyze the decompiled pseudo code in both match results:

```
int __cdecl sub_80E7110(int a1) // 1
{ // 2
  int v2; // [esp+8h] [ebp-4h] // 3
 // 4
  if ( **(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) == 771 && *(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(a1 + 88) + 836) + 36) == 49200 ) // 5
    v2 = 131200; // 6
  else // 7
    v2 = *(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(a1 + 88) + 836) + 36); // 8
  return v2; // 9
} // 10
```

Let me analyze this code and compare it with both versions:

1. The context shows TLS1_2_VERSION is 0x0303 (771 in decimal)
2. SSL_HANDSHAKE_MAC_DEFAULT and TLS1_PRF are both 0x10, and together would be 0x20 (32 decimal)
3. The critical part is the condition: `**(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) == 771`

Based on my research, I can determine:

1. `**(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8)` likely corresponds to `s->method->version` in the patched version or the result of `TLS1_get_version(s)` in the pre-patch version
2. The value 771 (0x0303) matches TLS1_2_VERSION
3. The check is for exact equality (==), not greater than or equal to (>=)

Now I'll provide my analysis:

```json
{
    "evidence": {
        "p_result_analysis": [
            "The condition **(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) == 771 exactly matches the patched version's equality check (s->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION)",
            "The value 771 (0x0303) corresponds to TLS1_2_VERSION",
            "The decompiled code uses an exact equality check (==) rather than a comparison (>=)"
        ],
        "v_result_analysis": [
            "The condition **(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) == 771 does not match the pre-patch version's comparison check (TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION)",
            "The pre-patch version would use a comparison (>=) operation, but the decompiled code uses equality (==)",
            "The direct access pattern to s->method->version matches the patched code's approach"
        ],
        "reasoning": "The decompiled code uses an exact equality check (**(_DWORD **)(a1 + 8) == 771) rather than a comparison. This directly matches the patched version's behavior where s->method->version is compared exactly to TLS1_2_VERSION (771/0x0303). The pre-patch version would check if TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION, which would result in different decompiled logic involving a comparison operator rather than equality. Additionally, the direct memory access pattern suggests a direct field access (s->method->version) rather than a function call result (TLS1_get_version(s))."
    },
    "correct_result": "patched version"
}
