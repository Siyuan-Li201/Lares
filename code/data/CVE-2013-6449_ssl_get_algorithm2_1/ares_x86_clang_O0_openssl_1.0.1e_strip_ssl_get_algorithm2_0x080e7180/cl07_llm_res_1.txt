Based on my analysis of the decompiled code compared against both patched and pre-patch versions, I can determine which version is more likely to be the correct match.

Let me analyze the key differences in the diff:

1. The critical change in the patch is replacing `TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION` with `s->method->version == TLS1_2_VERSION`
2. The context shows TLS1_2_VERSION is defined as 0x0303

Now I'll examine both match results against the decompiled code:

```
if ( v2 >= 771 && *(_DWORD *)(*(_DWORD *)(a1[22] + 836) + 36) == 49200 ) // 10
```

This is the key line in the decompiled pseudo code that corresponds to the if condition in the original C code.

Let's evaluate both matches:

{
    "evidence": {
        "p_result_analysis": [
            "The patched version changes from '>=' comparison to '==' equality check", 
            "The decompiled code shows 'v2 >= 771' which appears to be a version comparison"
        ],
        "v_result_analysis": [
            "Pre-patch version uses '>=' for version comparison", 
            "The decompiled code also uses '>=' in 'v2 >= 771' which aligns with pre-patch logic"
        ],
        "reasoning": "The critical change in the patch is replacing a version comparison using '>=' with a strict equality check '=='. Looking at the decompiled code line 10, it uses 'v2 >= 771' which maintains the same greater-than-or-equal logic as the pre-patch version. The decompiled code appears to follow the pre-patch pattern of checking if the version is at least TLS1_2_VERSION (likely represented as 771 in decimal) rather than checking for exact equality. Additionally, the initialization of v2 in lines 6-9 suggests it's getting a version value, which aligns with the TLS1_get_version(s) function from the pre-patch code rather than accessing a method version directly."
    },
    "correct_result": "pre-patch version"
}

The analysis shows that the code is using the pre-patch version because:

1. The condition in line 10 uses `v2 >= 771` which matches the pre-patch version's `TLS1_get_version(s) >= TLS1_2_VERSION` comparison logic (using greater-than-or-equal).
2. The value 771 (decimal) appears to represent TLS1_2_VERSION (0x0303 = 771 in decimal).
3. The code in lines 6-9 shows `v2` being calculated based on `*a1 >> 8 == 3`, which aligns with deriving a version number from a value, consistent with a function like TLS1_get_version().
4. The patched version would likely have a direct equality check against the method's version value, which doesn't match the decompiled logic.
