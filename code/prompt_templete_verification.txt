You are a software reverse engineer analyzing decompiled pseudo code. Your task is to determine whether the code is patched or pre-patch version by analyzing the reliability of matching results. Must only output your findings as a JSON dictionary.

INPUT:
1. Diff File: <patch_diff_label>
2. Variable Context: <comments_label>
3. P_result (patched version matches): <patch_result_json>
4. V_result (pre-patch version matches): <vul_result_json>

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Evaluate each match in p_result and v_result:
   - Semantic correctness
   - Logic consistency
   - Context compatibility
   - Potential false matches

2. Compare quality of matches:
   - Which version has more reliable matches
   - Which matches might be incorrect
   - Overall semantic alignment

RULES:
- Only one result (p_result or v_result) corresponds to the correct version
- Better semantic match determines the version

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
    "evidence": {
        "p_result_analysis": ["reliable matches", "suspicious matches"],
        "v_result_analysis": ["reliable matches", "suspicious matches"],
        "reasoning": "why one version's matches are more convincing"
    },
    "correct_result": "pre-patch version" or "patched version"
}
